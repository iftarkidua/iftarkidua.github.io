Iftar Ki Dua in Every Language

Welcome to the Iftar Ki Dua repository! 🌙

This project aims to provide the Iftar Dua (the supplication recited at the time of breaking the fast) in as many languages as possible. Whether you want to read it in Arabic, English, Urdu, French, or any other language, we’ve got you covered.

📜 The Dua (in Arabic)

اللَّهُمَّ إِنِّي لَكَ صُمْتُ وَبِكَ آمَنْتُ وَعَلَيْكَ تَوَكَّلْتُ وَعَلَى رِزْقِكَ أَفْطَرْتُ

Transliteration: Allahumma inni laka sumtu wa bika aamantu wa 'alayka tawakkaltu wa 'ala rizq-ika-aftartu.

Translation: O Allah! I fasted for You, and I believe in You, and I put my trust in You, and with Your sustenance, I break my fast.
